Enemies will be scattered in 1-2 km around that marker.<br/><br/>
Usually there won't be any other markers (except the side mission ones).<br/>
To obtain them, you will need to <t color='#00ff33'>approach civilians</t> in towns and use the option <t color='#00ff33'>Question Civilian</t> in the mousewheel menu.<br/><br/>
Some of them won't be cooperative, but sometimes you'll obtain some precious (but approximate) information about the enemy whereabouts.<br/>";
