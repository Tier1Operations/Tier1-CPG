"Comm Channels" hintC parseText "Tier 1 Operations is a gaming community which focuses on realism of the simulation and tactical gameplay.<br/><br/>
In order to better teamplay, we added <t color='#0000ff'>new custom VOIP channels</t> for all the users of this server.<br/><br/>
To enable them, scroll the mousewheel and use the <t color='#ff0000'>Open Radio Menu</t> command. Then, just turn on the channels you need, close the window and switch to those channels normally.<br/><br/>
<t color='#ff0000'>If the channels don't work</t>, have patience and try to <t color='#00ff00'>switch to other channels repeatedly</t> until everything works.<br/><br/>
If you want, you can connect to our TeamSpeak: <t color='#00ff33'>ts.tier1ops.eu - password: welcome</t>.";
